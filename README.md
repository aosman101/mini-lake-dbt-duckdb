# mini-lake-dbt-duckdb
This project delivers a laptop-based data engineering pipeline: raw CSV ingestion, transformations using dbt Core with the dbt-duckdb adapter, and results stored in a local DuckDB file. It implements a mini-lake structure (staging + mart layers), automated tests, and version-controlled SQL, offering practical experience in data engineering.
